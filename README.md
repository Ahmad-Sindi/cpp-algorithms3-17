# Algorithm Challenge #17 – Number Exists in Matrix (Level 3)

🧮 **Problem Description**
-
This program checks whether a given number exists inside a 3×3 matrix.

The algorithm scans the matrix element by element and immediately stops
once the number is found, making it both simple and efficient.

💡 **What You’ll Learn**
-
- Traversing a 2D matrix using nested loops
- Implementing search logic in fixed-size data structures
- Using early-exit optimization to reduce unnecessary computation
- Writing clean and reusable matrix-based functions
- Thinking in terms of search space and data coverage

🧩 **Example**
-
**Matrix:**
55 77 1

5 24 6

85 7 14


**Input:**
Enter number to search for: 24

**Output:**
Yes: Number exists in the matrix.

💬 **Notes**

This challenge shares structural similarity with other matrix-based problems
such as sparse matrix detection.  
However, instead of analyzing distribution, this algorithm focuses on
**search and early termination**, a core concept in efficient algorithm design.
